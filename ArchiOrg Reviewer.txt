1.The largest and most important circuit board in the computer is the ____________________, also called the main board or system board.

A. ROM
B. Motherboard
C. Processor/CPU
D. PCI

ANSWER
B. Motherboard The main board in the computer, also called the system board. The CPU, ROM chips, SIMMs, DIMMs, RIMMs, and interface cards are plugged into the motherboard.

2. In the world of computers, the term ____________________ refers to the computer’s physical components, such as the monitor, keyboard, memory chips, and hard drive.

A. Software
B. Hardware
C. Vaporware
D. Bioware

ANSWER
B. Hardware The physical components that constitute the computer system, such as the monitor, the keyboard, the motherboard, and the printer.

3. The ____________________ is a group of microchips on the motherboard that control the flow of data and instructions to and from the processor, providing careful timing of activities.

A. Mainframe
B. Tollhaus
C. Dual-core processor
D. Chipset

ANSWER
D. Chipset A group of chips on the motherboard that controls the timing and flow of data and instructions to and from the CPU.

4. This system of pathways used for communication and the protocol and methods used for transmission are collectively called the ____________________

A. Transmission Relay
B. Bus
C. USB
D. Bit conduits

ANSWER
B. Bus The paths, or lines, on the motherboard on which data, instructions, and electrical power move from component to component.

5. Different versions of UNIX are referred to as _____

A. Distributions
B. UAP
C. Torvalds
D. Applications

ANSWER
A. Distributions The term UNIX comprises a class of operating systems used to control networks and applications on the Internet. Versions of UNIX are referred to as flavors or distributions. LINUX is the most popular UNIX distribution.

6. In which of the following gates, the output is 1, if and only if at least one input is 1?

A. NOR
B. AND
C. OR
D. NAND

ANSWER 
C. OR gate  we need atleast one bit to be equal to 1 to generate the output as 1 because OR means  any of the condition out of two is equal to 1  which means  if atleast one input is 1 then it shows output as 1 . Number of 1's in input may be more than one but the output will always be 1 in OR gate. So the answer is 'C'.

7. The time required for a gate or inverter to change its state is called

A. Rise time
B. Decay time
C. Propagation time
D. Charging time

ANSWER 
C. Propagation time required for a signal or wave to travel from one point of a transmission medium to another.

8. The time required for a pulse to change from 10 to 90 percent of its maximum value is called


A. Rise time
B. Decay time
C. Propagation time
D. Operating speed

ANSWER 
A. Rise time taken for a signal to cross a specified lower voltage threshold followed by a specified upper voltage threshold. 

9. The maximum frequency at which digital data can be applied to gate is caled


A. one
B. two
C. three
D. four

ANSWER 
C. three Y=A+B. This is the equation of OR gate. We require 3 NAND gates to create  OR gate.  We can also write

After 1st NAND operation
Y = (A AND B)' 
Y=  A'  + B'  (Demorgan's Law)
After 2nd NAND operation
Y= ( A'  + B')'
Y=  A . B  (Demorgan's Law)
After 3rd  NAND operation
Y= ( A . B )'
Y=  A' +  B '  (Demorgan's Law)

So we need 3 NAND gates.

10. The time required for a pulse to decrease from 90 to 10 per cent of its maximum value is called

A. Rise time
B. Decay time
C. Binary level transition period
D. Propagation delay

ANSWER
B. Decay time required for a collection of atoms of a particular radionuclide to decay to a fraction of the initial number equal to 1/e, where e = 2.7182818 …, used as the base of natural logarithms.
